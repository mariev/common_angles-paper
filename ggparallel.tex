\IEEEPARstart{G}{raphics} are tools of communications: their main purpose is  to summarize quantitative information and present it in a way that readers are able to extract the main message quickly and with a minimum of distortion. Tufte  coined the amount of distortion the \emph{Lie-Factor} \citep[p. 57--69]{tufte}. The Lie-Factor is defined as the ratio of the displayed size of an effect and the size of the same effect in the data. A ratio of one indicates no distortion, values less than one indicate a visual underrepresentation of an effect, values above one a corresponding overrepresentation. Three-dimensional depth effects, in particular, are prone to large Lie-factors.

Another source of distortion are perceptual limitations of our audience. Illusions, in particular, give rise to a distortion similar to a Lie-Factor effect, yet not directly measurable in the actual representation: a physical quantity drawn in the chart might  perfectly reflect the  size of an effect in the data, but if an observer  intuitively interprets another property of the geometrical object, this leads  to distorted, if not altogether wrong, conclusions. 
As designers of charts we have to be aware of the innate or culturally imposed perceptual limitations of our audience. Good graphical designs minimize and counteract these limitations. 

In this paper we discuss the effect and strength of the {\it line-width illusion}  on designs related to displaying associations between categorical variables. We will focus in particular on the use of parallel coordinate plots \citep{pcp:1885, inselberg:1985, wegman:1990} for categorical data and the perceptual implications this has.

We will first give an overview of  charts commonly used for displaying associations between categorical variables within the framework of parallel coordinate plots, and then discuss their performance with respect to the line width illusion based on user experiments.

%The effectiveness of statistical graphs is rooted in the remarkable ability of people to apprehend, process, and remember pictorial information. The human visual system, however, is subject to distortion and illusion, processes that can affect the perception of graphs. Good graphical design can minimize and counteract the limitations of human vision. In Figure 9, for example, it appears that the difference between the hypothetical import and export series is changing when this difference actually is constant (cf., Playfair?s time series graph in Figure 2 a). 

\subsection{Line-width illusion}
As an example for the phenomenon under investigation in this paper, we refer you to the top chart in  figure  \ref{playfair}. 
This chart shows Playfair's  visualization of the balance of trade between England and the East Indies as published in his Commercial and Political Atlas, 1786 \cite{playfair, playfair2}. One of the purposes of this chart is to demonstrate the difference between imports and exports in a particular year and its pattern over the time frame. The difference in exports and imports is encoded as the vertical difference between the lines. When observers are asked to sketch out the difference between exports and imports  \citep{cleveland:1984}, they very often  miss the steep rise in the difference between the lines starting just before 1760 (see the chart at the bottom for the actual difference between imports and exports).


\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{playfair}
Playfair's chart from the Commercial and Political Atlas, 1786 (above). The sketch below shows  the difference between the lines for export and import - the steep rise in the difference around 1760  comes as a surprise to many onlookers.  }
\end{figure}


This phenomenon  is known and widely discussed in statistical graphics literature \citep{wainer:2000, robbins:2005}. It  is due to our  tendency to assess distance between curves as the minimal (orthogonal) distance rather than the  vertical distance -- see sketch \ref{fig:linewidth}.


In the perception literature, this phenomenon is known as part of a group of geometrical optical misperceptions of a context-sensitive nature classified as M\"uller-Lyer illusions \citep{day:1991}. Interestingly, there seems to be a general agreement that this illusion exists, but a quantification of it is curiously absent from the literature. 


%XXX Why don't we mention mosaics? - I don't want to, but we need a better reason


%Figure \ref{sine-illusion} shows a screen shot of applet displaying the sine illusion. The sine illusion is closely related to the line width phenomenon -- the line segments in the are of the steepest slope of the sine curve appear to be the shortest: ``The illusion is explained in terms of a perceptual compromise between the vertical extent and the greater overall dimensions of the section at the turn of the sine-wave figure and is thereby held to be the same in principle as the M\"uller-Lyer illusion." \citep{day:1991}.
%M Bach's applet \citep{bach} gives the option to compensate the line length manually for its perceived shortcoming. The amount of compensation chosen turns out to be highly dependent on both the length of the vertical line segments and the amplitude of the sine function. The amplitude directly affects the slope -- the steeper  the slope the more compensation is necessary, see section \ref{distortion}  for a more detailed discussion and some results from a user study.

\subsection{Parallel Set plots}


Parallel Sets have been introduced by R Kosara \citep{kosara:2006} as a way to visualize categorical data within the framework of parallel coordinate plots  and have by now spread into main media, see e.g. the article on decision making and risk assessment in the BBC \citep{bbc:2009}. 

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{images/parset-titanic}
\caption{\label{question1a} Parallel sets plot showing the relationship between survival of the sinking of the HMS Titanic and class membership. }
\end{figure}
%XXX Description of parallel sets - and example
Figure \ref{question1a} gives an example for a parallel sets plot of Survival on board the HMS Titanic  \citep{dawson:1995} and irs relationship to passenger status and crew membership -- this information is combined in the variable 'Class'.
 The top bar in figure \ref{question1a} shows the Class variable. Passengers are further divided into first, second or third class. The bottom bar shows survival  as yes and no. Between the bars lines are drawn to visualize the relationship between class membership and  survival. Based on the proportion of survivor and non survivors these bands are drawn from each class, and their (horizontal) width is proportional to the number of people they represent. 
%XXX PS and line-width illusion
This definition makes parallel sets susceptible to the line width illusion. When we, for example, try to order passenger class and crew membership according to their respective numbers of survivors, we need to evaluate the width of the bands between upper and lower bars in figure \ref{question1a}.
The  perceived width of the lines between the variables in figure \ref{question1a} would  lead us to assume that 1st class passengers had the highest number of survivors, followed by 3rd class passengers and about even numbers of survivors in the 2nd class  and  the crew. However, the  actual numbers are:
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
& Crew & 1st & 2nd & 3rd \\ \hline
Survivors & 212 & 203 & 118 & 178\\
Non-Survivors & 673 & 122 & 167 &  528  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
This identifies an order of crew, first class, third class, followed by second class as correct. We will discuss the origin and effects that determine the strength of the line width illusion in the next section.

%
\subsection{Strength of the line width illusion}\label{distortion}

%The difference between perceived and actual line width 
The line width illusion in the parallel sets is brought on by a strong preference of evaluating the width of lines orthogonal to their slopes as opposed to horizontally (see sketch \ref{fig:linewidth}), as would be needed for a correct assessment.
Orthogonal $w_o$ and horizontal $w_h$ line widths are related -- the orthogonal line width depends on the angle (or slope) of the line:
\begin{equation}\label{adjust}
w_o = w_h \sin \theta,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle of the line with respect to the horizontal line.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/linewidth}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig:linewidth}Sketch of line width assessments: (a) is showing  horizontal width, (b) shows  width orthogonal to the slope. From the survey results in section \ref{results} we can see that  observers associate line width more with  orthogonal width (b) than horizontal width (a).}
\end{figure}



%XXX aspect ratio


\begin{figure*}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{images/aspect31-titanic.pdf}
\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{images/aspect33-titanic.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig:aspect}Parallel sets plots of survival on the Titanic by class. Different aspect ratios  seemingly change the (orthogonal) line width, compare e.g. number of survivors in 3rd class and in the crew. }
\end{figure*}

The perceived slope of a line very much depends on the aspect ratio of the corresponding plot -- changing the height to width ratio of a display  will change our perception of the corresponding line widths, if they are not adjusted for the slope \cite{cleveland:1984}. This finding is not new, but its strength on our perception is surprising, as can be seen in the example of  figure \ref{fig:aspect}.  Again, survival and class membership on the Titanic is shown; the same parallel sets plot is shown twice in this figure, but with very different aspect ratios: in the  plot on the left the number of surviving 3rd class passengers seems to be about twice as big as the number of survivors among crew members, whereas in the plot on the right the lines have about equal (orthogonal) width. Obviously, this is not due to a change in numbers, nor a change in the way the plot is rendered. Our (intuitive) evaluation of the situation does change, though, and as designers of good graphics we have to accommodate for that the best we can. Reordering categories, as well as controlling the aspect ratio to avoid huge differences in the slope of lines helps reduce the potential of drawing wrong conclusions from these plot, but none of these measures is enough to avoid all perceptual pitfalls due to the line width illusion.

\subsection{Hammock Plots}
%XXX Description of hammock plots and example

Hammock plots, introduced by M Schonlau in \citep{schonlau:2003}, provide an alternative to parallel sets that is adjusted for the line width illusion. This is done by  adjusting the --horizontal-- line width by  a factor of $\sin \theta$, as discussed in equation (\ref{adjust}). This adjustment makes the perceived --orthogonal-- line width to be proportional to the number of observations it represents. 
 Figure \ref{hammock} shows an example of a four dimensional hammock plot of the Titanic data. From top to bottom Class, Gender, Survival, and again Class are shown. 
\begin{figure}
%cols <- c(brewer.pal(name="Blues", 6)[-c(1,2)], rev(brewer.pal(name="Oranges", 3)[-1]), rev(brewer.pal(name="Greens",3)[-1]))
%ggparallel(names(titanic)[c(1,4,2,1)], order=c(0,1,1,0), method="hammock", ratio=.25, text.angle=0, titanic, weight="Freq") +
%  scale_fill_manual(values=cols, guide="none") +
%  scale_colour_manual(values=cols, guide="none") + coord_flip() 
%ggsave("hammock-titanic.pdf", width=6, height=8)
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{hammock-titanic}
\caption{\label{hammock} Hammock plot of the relationship between Class and Survival on the Titanic. }
\end{figure}

Similar to the parallel sets plot, the bars are divided according to class membership numbers.  Lines connect categories between neighboring bars, orthogonal line widths are representing the number of individuals in each combination. Unlike the parallel sets, the lines start from the middle of the bin and connect to the middle of the other variable's bins. 
%Line widths are adjusted in such a way, that the orthogonal width (see sketch \ref{fig:linewidth}) represents numbers.

Here, we see that barely any women were in the crew, while male crew members make up the second largest contingent overall. Overall a few more men survived than women, proportionally the situation is much different -- a much higher percentage of women survived than men. We also see, that more first class passengers survived than not, while second class passengers survival chances were about fifty-fifty. For third class passengers and crew members fewer members did  survive than not. 

As the adjustment of line widths is made with respect to the angle $\theta$, which itself depends on the aspect ratio of a plot, we need complete control over these properties of the plotting device when constructing Hammock plots  -- in our implementation (see below for details) we have dealt with this issue by fixing the aspect ratio. This is problematic in some situations, where the rendering has to be done without knowledge of the plotting device. 

Another problem that arises in evaluating hammock plots is that if an observer focuses on horizontal line width  the plots suffer from a {\it reverse line width illusion}:  judging the number of survivors by class in figure \ref{hammock} based on horizontal line width  results in an ordering of (largest to smallest) Crew, 3rd, 1st, and 2nd - which is not correct either. Using horizontal width is inviting, since the lines are centered around the middle of a level, facilitating this  comparison. 

In this paper, we propose a new approach to visualizing relationships between categorical variables in a parallel coordinate plot setting, called the {\it common angle} display. 


\section{ Common Angle Plots}
\subsection{Construction}


\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
%ggparallel(names(titanic)[c(1,4,2,1)], order=c(0,1,1,0), titanic, weight="Freq", text.angle=0) +

%  scale_colour_manual(values=cols, guide="none") + coord_flip() 
%ggsave("ca-titanic.pdf", width=6, height=6)
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ca-titanic} 
   \caption{ \label{fig:ca-titanic} Common Angle plot of the Titanic data. }
  \end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ca-titanic} shows a common angle plot of the same data as the hammock plot.

As in the previously discussed display types ribbons are drawn between categories with widths  that are proportional to  the number of records they represent.

In order to ensure that  widths of all bands are  comparable without any distortion, their slopes  are artificially made the same in the following manner: 
assuming a vertical display as shown in figure \ref{fig:ca-titanic}, we modify  the connecting bands between  categories from a straight band  to a combination of a vertical  segment, a  segment under a pre-specified angle $\theta$, followed by another vertical  segment.  
The pre-specified angle $\theta$ (between the line and the vertical band) is given as --at most-- the angle of the longest connecting line between two categories of neighboring variables. 
This makes the width of ribbons  comparable without being affected by the distortion, as all ribbons are sharing at least one segment under the same angle. 

\subsection{Origins}
Historically, the common angle diagram has its roots in Sankey diagrams \citep{sankey:1898}. Sankey diagrams have their origin and main use of application in the area of industrial engineering. They are often used to show flows,  particularly, in the framework of energy consumption and losses within systems.
One of the most famous charts that can be classified as a Sankey diagram is Minard's map of Napoleon's march on Moscow \citep{minard:1812}. This map  shows the size of the army as a flow chart from West to East and the subsequent retreat. Usually, Sankey diagrams do not show a geographic co-variate, though. Modern uses of Sankey diagrams are discussed in  detail in \citep{schmidt:2008};  they can also be found in charts designed by Jen Christiansen, such as in \cite{jen3} and \cite{jen2}.

\subsection{Extension: Hammock-adjusted common angle plots}
As a logical next step in making ribbons comparable across all their parts and multiple variables, we can additionally adjust sloped parts of the ribbons using the hammock-adjustment described above. This leads to a representation as shown in figure \ref{adj.angle}. Note that ribbons no longer are required to fill the marginal bars. This choice was made to reduce the amount of overplotting resulting from the increase in width of the lines under an angle. The hammock adjustment results in re-introducing the aspect ratio as a crucial quantity.

\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Survey Design}
% description of general design
To determine the effectiveness of the common angle display, we conducted a user experiment in form of a survey asking participants to provide responses regarding the structure in two data sets with predominantly categorical variables.

 All individuals were presented with the same six questions, in two blocks of three questions each. The first block of questions investigated structures in the Titanic data set, including a follow-up of the survival-class ordering issue discussed earlier. Participants were exposed to one of the three types of displays discussed: a parallel sets plot, the Hammock plot of figure \ref{hammock}, or the common angle plot of  figure \ref{fig:ca-titanic}.
 
The second block  of questions regarded gene-pathway relationships in a dataset constructed from the UCSC Genome Browser \cite{ucsc:2002} for humane genome assembly. Ribbon widths here indicate the number of genes on a  chromosome that are active in a particular pathway. The pathways we focus on here, are involved in caffeine metabolism (hsa00232),  steroid biosynthesis (hsa00100), and hsa00982, which is involved with drug metabolism via the cytochrome P450 superfamily.  One important question when dealing with drug development are interactions with other drugs. Those interactions are more likely to happen when pathways use similar locations, e.g. gene CYP1A2 is involved in both  caffeine metabolism and the drug pathway -- clomipramine (an antidepressant) and caffeine both may act as a substrate. Chromosomes give a --very rough-- approximation to location. Connections between chromosomes and pathways are therefore interesting, when they show involvement of chromosomes in several pathways.
 
%% Marie, I'm not quite sure what  clomipramine has to do with either durgs or caffeine - or is clomipramine a drug that uses hsa00982? If so, we might need an additional sentence here.
 
Participants were asked a second set of three questions (see appendix \ref{app2} for details) on this data set, but they were exposed to a  type of display different from the type accompanying questions from block 1.
  
This resulted in six different survey administrations: 

{
\scalebox{0.9}{
\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrr}
Block 1 & PS & CA & Ham & PS & CA & PS \\ 
 Block 2 & CA & PS & PS & Ham & Ham & CA \\ \hline
\#responses &  9 &  8 &  9 &  7 & 11 & 11 \\ 
\end{tabular}}}

%% however the type of chart provided as reference for answering questions varied randomly among the types described previously. 
%%
%%In the survey, participants were first asked three questions regarding the titanic dataset, three questions regarding the gene dataset,  then two questions soliciting feedback regarding plot types, allowing for free response.

\noindent
This design allows us to compare designs across different questions and data sets, while at the same time allowing to adjust for individuals' different skill sets. 
For the analysis, we first fit two linear mixed effects models, $M1$ and $M2$ -- the first one gives a general overview of comparing the designs, the second one further highlights the performance of the designs in each question.
We will then proceed to investigate some of the results in more detail.



%See appendix for details regarding the survey demographics, and data.

%XXX discussion of datasets
%XXX biological findings - pathways - what are the new findings?
%One application using biochemical pathway data is visualization of screening for drug interaction. Setting one bar to classify by pathways and a second bar to classify by physical location (e.g. chromosome), the ribbon widths indicate the number of genes on a particular chromosome that are active in a pathway. A chromosome with ribbons connecting to multiple pathways are a physical target for drugs that possibly affect both paths. In Figure XXX the bottom bar shows two pathways: hsa00232, which is involved in caffeine metabolism, and hsa00982, which is involved with drug metabolism via the cytochrome P450 superfamily. The top bar classifies by chromosome location. Gene CYP1A2 is involved in both pathways - clomipramine (an antidepressant) and caffeine both may act as a substrate.



\subsection{Results and Analysis}\label{results}
\subsubsection{Mixed effects models}
Answers for each question on the survey were assessed for correctness, giving us a binary variable of 1s and 0s, which we used to investigate performance of different designs. 

In a first model, $M1$, we are only interested in the overall difference in performance between designs. We can express this as a model of the form
\begin{equation}\label{model1}[M1]
\qquad\qquad y_i = \mu + d_{j(i)} + u_{k(i)} + \varepsilon_i \qquad\qquad
\end{equation}
where $y_i$ is the $i$th response, for $i = 1, ..., n$. $d_{j(i)}$ is the parameter measuring the effect of design $j$ ($j = C, H, P$ for \underline{C}ommon Angle, \underline{H}ammock plot, and \underline{P}arallel sets plot), $u_{k(i)}$ is the effect of participant's $k$ individual skills in evaluating these plots, $k \in \{1, ..., XXX\}$. The assumption is that skills are independent and normally distributed with an expected value of zero and a variance of $\sigma_u^2$.
$\varepsilon_i$ is, similarly to a regular linear model, assumed to be independently distributed according to a normal distribution with mean of zero and variance $\sigma^2$.

Table \ref{coef1} gives an overview of the model coefficients and their estimates. The effect of the common angle design is used as a baseline, i.e all the effects shown are differences with respect to the performance of common angle plots. Both Hammock plots and Parallel sets plot have negative effects on the correctness of the response. This indicates a significantly worse performance of these designs than under the common angle design.

Table \ref{raw} shows percentages of correctness for each design and each question. Bold numbers indicate significantly different (worse) performance of a design compared to the common angle design. Note that question $A2$ overall had the worst performance, parallel sets  exhibit significantly worse performance in four out of the six questions, Hammock plots are inferior to the common angle plot in two out the six questions. Note that in the last question Hammock plots have the best performance -- but this is does not  constitute a significant difference to the performance of the common angle design.
Also note, that the table shows raw percentages, i.e. these performance rates are not adjusted for skills of individuals.

Model $M2$ extends the first model by including both  effects for individual questions and the interaction effects with each design in the following form:
\begin{equation}\label{model2}[M2]
\quad y_i = \mu + d_{j(i)}  + q_{q(i)} + p_{j(i),q(i)} + u_{k(i)} + \varepsilon_i \quad
\end{equation}
Here, $q$ indicates the effects on performance for  each question, where $q(i)$ describes one of the questions $\{A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3\}$. $p$ is the parameter for the interaction effect of design and question, its index is a tuple consisting of a combination of a question and design. 

Model $M2$ is a significant improvement over model $M1$ (a corresponding log-likelihood ratio test is significant at a level of $<< 10^{-8}$).
Table \ref{model2} shows an overview of the  parameters and their estimates for model $M2$. After adjusting for individuals' skills Parallel sets perform significantly worse than common angle plots in three of the six questions.

% results from preliminary survey
%Table \ref{tab:results} shows an overview of the results: 7 out of 12 participants evaluating the barcharts identified the correct order, whereas none of the 13 participants evaluating the parallel sets plot did (a Mantel-Haenszel test yields a $p$-value of 0.015, which is indicative of a significant difference between the proportions of correct answers.) The most prominent ordering for the parallel sets plot 
%put 'Crew' into third spot, while leaving the order of the other class levels unchanged. 212 members of the crew survived, while only 178 passengers of the third class did. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Evidence for line width illusions}

Question $A2$ asked participants to order  class levels  according to the number of survivors, fewest to highest. There are 4! = 24 distinct orderings of the levels, corresponding to all permutations of length 4. Some orderings are closer to one another than other orderings. The Cayley distance defines a way to quantify the distance between  each pair of permutations; the Cayley distance is defined as the minimal number of transpositions, i.e. swaps of two elements,  necessary to transform one permutation into the other.
We can make use of this distance to define a graph on the space of all permutations: let all permutations be nodes of the graph; for each two permutations with a Cayley distance of one, we add an edge to this graphs. This results in a regular graph of degree six, i.e. each  node is connected to six other nodes in the graph. The Cayley distance between any two nodes is then given as the length of the shortest path between the nodes through the graph.
Figure \ref{cubes} shows an overview of the permutation space together with an overview of the survey results. Each permutation is represent by one dot. 

% - each ordering is represented by one dot. 
%XXX Discuss Caley distance: minimal number of transpositions necessary to move from one ordering to the other.
%Orderings that with a Caley distance of one, i.e.  orderings that ate only one swap of levels apart, are connected by a line, yielding a regular graph of degree 6, i.e.  each node connects to  six other nodes. 
The colored dots on top of the graph correspond to the responses from the survey - the size of the dots is proportional to the number of observers choosing this particular ordering. It becomes obvious from the three graphs in figure \ref{cubes} that
the answers to different designs occupy quite different regions, while answers based  on the same design are quite close --  usually separated by only one edge. 

The correct ordering, as well as the orderings assuming the line width illusion and its reverse are marked with symbols. Answers for the common angle design are centered around the correct answer, while responses to parallel sets are cluster around the response corresponding to the line width illusion. Due to the small number of responses to the hammock design a clear clustering of the answers is not recognizable, but the answer for the inverse line width illusion is among the responses. Table \ref{a2} gives an overview of all responses to question $A.2$.

Common angle displays show the best performance in terms of correctness (63.2\% on 19 responses), compared to a correctness of 7.4\% for parallel sets plots on 27 responses, indicating a significantly better performance of common angle plots at a level of 0.00022, based on a Mantel-Haenszel test (the difference in performance to Hammock plots is also significant at a level of 0.01162; but there is no significant difference in correctness between Hammock plots and parallel sets.).
While the intuitive assessment of line widths by their width orthogonal to slope is well known, it is surprising to see its strength: in this particular setting, it is strong enough to `shrink' the horizontally widest line for 11 out of 27 participants by at least  44\%, from 212 to below 118, and a further 5 participants perceived the shrinking to below 178, which constitutes a distortion of at least 16\%.

Table \ref{tab:b1} shows a summary to the  three questions of $B.1$ with possible answers ``agree", ``disagree", and ``don't know".
The first two questions are  examples, where the line width illusion, and its reverse will lead to answers that differ from the correct answer. Parallel sets plots are susceptible to the line width illusion, while hammock plots suffer from the reverse. The data shows that in about 50\% of the responses we can see this difference. 8 out of 15 answers for the parallel sets plots in question 1 deviate from the correct answer, and 7 out of 16 responses corresponding to hammock plots in question 2 show the wrong answer.

\section{Implementation}

All  of the discussed variants of parallel coordinate plots for categorical data are implemented as part of the package {\tt ggparallel} based on the {\tt ggplot2} \cite{ggplot2} plotting framework in the software {\tt R} 2.15.1 \citep{R}. The  {\tt ggparallel} package is freely available from CRAN (\url{http://www.r-project.org/}).
The colors for the plots have been chosen using color schemes from the ColorBrewer project  \cite{colorbrewer} , as implemented in the R package {\tt RColorBrewer}  \cite{RColorBrewer} .

%\subsection*{Demographics of the pre-cursory survey I}\label{app1}
%33 students, staff and faculty from Iowa State University participated in the survey investigating the strength of the perceptual line width distortion. The Qualtrics system \cite{} was used to create the survey and all students, staff and faculty from programs in Statistics, Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and Human Computer Interaction were invited to participate by email. No personally identifiable information was collected, nor was any compensation offered. Participants used their own personal computing devices to access the survey. A majority of participants used WoW64 (Windows 32-bit or Windows 64-bit), with the next most common operating system Intel Mac OS X10.6.8 (Snow Leopard). The preferred choice of browser was  Chrome, followed by Firefox. For two participants, the Qualtrics survey software was unable to capture operating system or browser information.
%
%One question in this survey asked participants to rank the number of survivors in the titanic dataset by class. The results are summarized in table  \ref{tab:results} .


%No participants chose to do so using internet explorer.

% In contrast to that, a second question asking participants to order class levels according to survival {\it rates} of members did not yield any indication that parallel sets were performing less efficiently than barcharts; 11 out of 12 (barcharts) and 12 out of 13 (parallel sets) participants were able to answer this question correctly. The answer was also based on either figure \ref{question1a} or \ref{question1b}. While the line width illusion is present, its effect for this instance is not strong enough to have an impact on the order of the results.



\subsection*{Survey }\label{app2}
All students, staff and faculty from Iowa State University programs in Statistics, Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and Human Computer Interaction were invited to participate by email. 93 individuals accessed the survey, with 47 individuals submitting responses for all questions. As in the first survey, participants used their own personal computing devices to access the survey, which was created using Qualtrics Labs, Inc software. No personally identifiable information was collected, nor was any compensation offered. At the survey start, participants were presented a brief tutorial regarding the different plot types.  \\

\noindent The questions pertaining to the titanic dataset were: \\ \\
\begin{itemize}
\item[A1.]\emph{Agree, Disagree or Don't Know/Can't Determine with the following statements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item There were an approximately equal number of Male and Female Survivors
\item The group with largest number of travelers was Female Survivors
\item There were more Male Non-Survivors than number of males in First AND Second Class Combined
\end{itemize}

\item[A2.]\emph{Order the categories of Class by number Survived, fewest to most.} 
\begin{itemize}
\item 1st
\item 2nd 
\item 3rd
\item Crew
\end{itemize}

\item[A3.]\emph{Order the following groups by number, fewest to most}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1st Class female passengers
\item Male Survivors
\item Crew Survivors
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\noindent \\  The questions pertaining to the gene dataset were: 


\begin{itemize}
\item[B1.]\emph{Agree, Disagree or Don't Know/Can't Determine with the following statements:}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are about the same number of genes in the group "steroid biosynthesis:chromosome 1" as in the group "caffeine metabolism: chromosome 8"
\item The group with the greatest number of genes is "drug metabolism:chromosome 4"
\item there are more genes involved in the group "drug metabolism: chromosome 1" than all genes involved in the caffeine metabolism pathway
\end{itemize}

\item[B2.]\emph{Order the following chromosomes by number of genes involved in steroid biosynthesis pathway, fewest to most.}
\begin{itemize}
\item chromosome 1
\item chromosome 4
\item chromosome 8 
\item chromosome X
\end{itemize}

\item[B3.]\emph{Order the following chromosomes by number of genes involved, fewest to most.}
\begin{itemize}
\item steroid biosynthesis :: chromosome X
\item steroid biosynthesis :: chromosome 4
\item drug metabolism :: chromosome X
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize} 

\noindent \\Participants were randomly assigned to one of six blocks, each of approximately equal size. While individuals in all blocks were presented with the same questions and datasets in the order shown above, each block was presented with a unique ordering of only two of the plot types (e.g parallel sets and hammock plot; common angles and parallel sets, etc) to use as reference when respon. This study design structure was imposed, in part,  to encourage participation by reducing the amount of time for survey completion. Completion of all survey questions was anticipated to take 10 - 15 minutes.

\subsection*{Data and preprocessing}
Data for questions A1, A2 and A3 in survey 2 were previously published in: \citep{dawson:1995}.

Data for questions B1, B2 and B3 in survey 2 was obtained using the UCSC Genome Browser \cite{ucsc:2002} for humane genome assembly (hg18, May2006). The data was subsetted for genes involved in pathways hsaXXX (drug metabolism), hsaXXX (caffeine metabolism), and hsaXXX (steroid biosynthesis). From this data, genes active on selected chromosomes were displayed in plots.

All data manipulation was performed  using software {\tt R} 2.15.1 \citep{R} with Bioconductor package KEGG.db \cite{kegg}
%
%\subsection*{Discussion of Sine Illusion}
%Using the notation given in the applet, we assume a value $s$ for the sine amplitude, $\ell$ for the vertical length of line segments, and $\ell_c$ for the amount of compensation. 
%The sine curve is then given by function $f$, written as 
%\[
%f(x) = s/2 \sin(x)
%\]
%for $x$ in $[-\pi, \pi]$. The slope of the sine curve is the steepest in its reflection point at $x=0$. We can calculate the slope as $f^\prime(x) = s/2 \cos(x)$, which in $x=0$ yields a slope of $s/2$.
%
%The physical dimensions of the applet are 500 pixels by 500 pixels, corresponding to an extent in the $x$ axis of $2 \pi$ and a maximum amplitude and line lengths of 250 in the $y$ axis. This results in an aspect ratio of $250 : (2\pi)$.
%For the physical angle $\theta$ of the slope with respect to the horizontal axis we get
%\[
%\tan \theta =  s/2 \cdot 2\pi/250 = s\pi/250
%\]
%Adding a compensation of $\ell_c$ to the length of line segments is supposed to make the orthogonal width of the region of the steepest slope appear as wide as the vertical length in the turning point. Since the slope in the turning point is zero, the extent of the width is unchanged and is therefore equal to $\ell$. 
%We therefore get for an `optimal' compensation as
%\[
%\ell \stackrel{!}{=} \cos \theta \cdot \left( \ell + \ell_c \right),
%\]
%yielding 
%\[
%\ell_c = \left(1 - \cos \theta\right)/\cos \theta \ \  \ell.
%\]
%theta <- function(s) atan(s*pi/250)
%compensate <- function(theta) (1-cos(theta))/cos(theta)

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
