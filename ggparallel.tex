% Computer Society journal papers do something a tad strange with the very
% first section heading (almost always called "Introduction"). They place it
% ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls currently does not do this for you.
% However, You can achieve this effect by making LaTeX jump through some
% hoops via something like:
%
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \noindent\raisebox{2\baselineskip}[0pt][0pt]%
%  {\parbox{\columnwidth}{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}%

%\fi
%
% Admittedly, this is a hack and may well be fragile, but seems to do the
% trick for me. Note the need to keep any \label that may be used right
% after \section in the above as the hack puts \section within a raised box.

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he}   main purpose of graphics is to summarize data and present them in a way that readers are able to extract the main message(s) quickly and with a minimum of distortion (cleveland, tufte - lie-factor). 

As designers of charts we have to be aware of the innate or culturally imposed perceptual limitations of our audience.
%
In this paper we focus on the use of parallel coordinate plots \citep{pcp:1885, inselberg:1985, wegman:1990} for categorical data and the perceptual implications this has.

%% from http://what-when-how.com/sociology/statistical-graphics/
%The effectiveness of statistical graphs is rooted in the remarkable ability of people to apprehend, process, and remember pictorial information. The human visual system, however, is subject to distortion and illusion, processes that can affect the perception of graphs. Good graphical design can minimize and counteract the limitations of human vision. In Figure 9, for example, it appears that the difference between the hypothetical import and export series is changing when this difference actually is constant (cf., Playfair’s time series graph in Figure 2 a). 

The top chart in Figure \ref{playfair} shows Playfair's  visualization of the balance of trade between England and the East Indies as published in his Commercial and Political Atlas, 1786 \cite{playfair, playfair2}. The chart at the bottom of  figure \ref{playfair}, where a line is sketched for the difference between imports and exports. The steep rise in the difference between the lines starting just before 1760 is missed by many onlookers. This phenomenon  is known and widely discussed in statistical graphics literature \citep{cleveland:1984, wainer:2000, robbins:2005}. The line width illusion is due to our  tendency to assess distance between curves as the minimal (orthogonal) distance rather than the  vertical distance -- see sketch \ref{fig:linewidth}.



%XXX Why don't we mention mosaics? - I don't want to, but we need a better reason

\end{figure}

In the perception literature, the phenomenon is known as part of a group of geometrical optical misperceptions classified as M\"uller-Lyer illusions \citep{day:1991}. Figure \ref{sine-illusion} shows a screen shot of applet displaying the sine illusion. The sine illusion is closely related to the line width phenomenon -- the line segments in the are of the steepest slope of the sine curve appear to be the shortest: ``The illusion is explained in terms of a perceptual compromise between the vertical extent and the greater overall dimensions of the section at the turn of the sine-wave figure and is thereby held to be the same in principle as the M\"uller-Lyer illusion." \citep{day:1991}
M Bach's applet \citep{bach} gives the option to compensate the line length manually for its perceived shortcoming. The amount of compensation chosen turns out to be highly dependent on both the length of the vertical line segments and the amplitude of the sine function. The amplitude directly affects the slope -- the steeper  the slope the more compensation is necessary, see section \ref{distortion}  for a more detailed discussion and some results from a user study.


\begin{figure}
\centering \includegraphics[width=.75\linewidth]{sine-illusion}
\caption{Screenshot of an applet by M Bach \citep{bach} showing an example of a sine illusion. The applet is giving the possibility for compensating the line lengths in the regions with the highest slope. }
\label{sine-illusion}
\end{figure}

We will next give an overview of  charts commonly used for displaying associations between categorical variables within the framework of parallel coordinate plots, and discuss their performance with respect to the line width illusion.


\subsection{Parallel Set Plots}


Parallel Sets have been introduced by R Kosara \citep{kosara:2006} as a way to visualize categorical data within the framework of parallel coordinate plots  and have by now spread into main media, see e.g. the article on decision making in the BBC \citep{bbc:2009}. 

%XXX Description of parallel sets - and example
Figure \ref{question1a} gives an example for a parallel sets of the Titanic data \citep{dawson:1995}. The top bar shows classification of people on board according to their status as crew member and passengers. Passengers are further divided into first, second or third class. The bottom bar shows survival status as yes and no for non-survival. Between the bars lines are drawn to visualize survival status according to class membership. Based on the proportion of survivor and non survivors bands are drawn from each class, the (horizontal) width of which is proportional to the number of people they represent. 

However, the parallel sets plot suffers from the line width illusion, that can in extreme cases be so severe as to lead the user to wrong conclusions about the displayed data.  Section \ref{distortion} will show more details on the strength of this illusion.


\subsection{Strength of the Linewidth Illusion}\label{distortion}

In a first survey (described in more detail in section \ref{app1}), we asked participants to rank class  levels according to the number of survivors (from highest to lowest) based on one of the two plots in figures \ref{question1a} and \ref{question1b}. The actual number of survivors by class are

\label{tab:results}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Other results from the survey?

Table \ref{tab:results} shows an overview of the results from the survey: 7 out of 12 participants evaluating the barcharts identify the correct order, whereas none of the 13 participants evaluating the parallel sets plot do (a Mantel-Haenszel test yields a $p$-value of 0.015, indicating a significant difference between the proportion of correct responses).
The line width illusion is brought on by a strong preference of evaluating the width of lines orthogonal to their slopes as opposed to horizontally (see sketch \ref{fig:linewidth}), as would be needed for a correct assessment of the parallel sets plot.
Orthogonal $w_o$ and horizontal $w_h$ line widths are related -- the orthogonal line width depends on the angle (or slope) of the line:
\[
w_o = w_h \cos \theta,
\]
where $\theta$ is the angle of the line with respect to the horizontal line.
While the intuitive assessment of line widths by their width orthogonal to slope is well known, it is surprising to see its strength: in this particular setting, it is strong enough to `shrink' the horizontally widest line for 8 out of 13 participants by more than 16\%, from 212 to below 178 (see table \ref{tab:results} for the survey results and table above for the actual number of survivors by class). 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/linewidth}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig:linewidth}Sketch of line width assessments: (a) is showing the horizontal width, (b) is  width orthogonal to the slope. Participants preferred method (b) over (a).}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}[htbp]

\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{images/aspect31-titanic.pdf}
\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{images/aspect33-titanic.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig:aspect}Parallel sets plots of survival on the Titanic by class. Different aspect ratios  seemingly change the (orthogonal) line width, compare e.g. number of survivors in 3rd class and in the crew. }
\end{figure*}

The slope of a line very much depends on the aspect ratio of the corresponding plot - changing the height to width ratio of a display  will change our perception of the corresponding line widths, if they are not adjusted for the slope. Figure \ref{fig:aspect} shows an example for that. The same parallel sets plot is shown twice in this figure, but with very different aspect rations: again, we are looking at survival on the Titanic. In the left plot the number of surviving 3rd class passengers seems to be about twice as big as the number of survivors among crew members, whereas on the right the lines have about equal (orthogonal) width. Obviously, the numbers don't change, but our (intuitive) evaluation of the situation does. Reordering categories, as well as controlling the aspect ratio to avoid huge differences in the slope of lines helps reduce the potential of drawing wrong conclusions from these plot, but none of these measures is enough to avoid all perceptual traps.

\subsection{Hammock Plots}
%XXX Description of hammock plots and example

Hammock plots \citep{schonlau:2003} provide an alternative to parallel sets that does not suffer from the distortion. Figure \ref{hammock} shows an example of a four dimensional hammock plot of the Titanic data. From top to bottom Class, Gender, Survival, and again Class are shown. 
\begin{figure}
%ggparallel(names(titanic)[c(1,4,2,1)], order=0, method="hammock", angle=0, titanic, weight="Freq") +
%scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired", guide="none") +
%scale_colour_brewer(palette="Paired", guide="none") + coord_flip()
%ggsave("hammock-titanic.pdf", width=6, height=8)
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{hammock-titanic}
\caption{\label{hammock} Hammock plot of the Titanic Data. }
\end{figure}

Similar to the parallel sets plot, the bars are divided according to class membership numbers.  Lines connect categories between neighboring bars, line widths are representing the number of individuals in each combination. Unlike the parallel sets, the lines start from the middle of the bin and connect to the middle of the other variable's bin. Line widths are adjusted in such a way, that the orthogonal width (see sketch \ref{fig:linewidth}) represents numbers.

In this example, we see that barely any women were in the crew, while male crew members make up the second largest contingent overall. While a few more men survived than women, proportionally the situation is much different -- a much higher percentage of women survived than men. We also see, that more first class passengers survived than not, while second class passengers survival chances were about fifty-fifty. For third class passengers and crew members fewer members did  survive than not. 

Since the adjustment of line widths is made with respect to the angle $\theta$, which itself depends on the aspect ratio of a plot, we need complete control over these properties of the plotting device when constructing Hammock plots  -- in our implementation (see below for details) we have dealt with this issue by fixing the aspect ratio. This is problematic in some situation, where the rendering has to be done without knowledge of the plotting device. 



In this paper, we propose a new approach to visualizing categorical variables in a parallel coordinate plot setting, called the {\it common angle} display. 


\section{ Common Angle Plots}
\subsection{Construction}


\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
%titanic <- as.data.frame(Titanic)
%ggparallel(names(titanic)[c(1,4,2,1)], order=c(0,1,1,0), titanic, weight="Freq", angle=0) + 
%   scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired", guide="none") + 
%   scale_colour_brewer(palette="Paired", guide="none") +
%   coord_flip()
%ggsave("ca-titanic.pdf", width=6, height=8)
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ca-titanic} 
   \caption{Common Angle plot of the Titanic data. }
   \label{fig:ca-titanic}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ca-titanic} shows a common angle plot of the same data as the hammock plot.

As in the previously discussed display types ribbons are drawn between categories with widths  that are proportional to  the number of records they represent.

In order to ensure that their widths are all comparable without any distortion, their slopes  are artificially made the same in the following manner: 
assuming a vertical display as shown in figure \ref{fig:ca-titanic}, we modify  the connecting bands between  categories from a straight band  to a combination of a vertical  segment, a  segment under a pre-specified angle $\theta$, followed by another vertical  segment.  
The pre-specified angle $\theta$ (between the line and the vertical band) is given as --at most-- the angle of the longest connecting line between two categories of neighboring variables. 
This makes the width of ribbons  comparable without being affected by the distortion, since all ribbons are sharing at least one segment that has the same angle.
