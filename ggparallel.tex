\section{Introduction}
% Computer Society journal papers do something a tad strange with the very
% first section heading (almost always called "Introduction"). They place it
% ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls currently does not do this for you.
% However, You can achieve this effect by making LaTeX jump through some
% hoops via something like:
%
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \noindent\raisebox{2\baselineskip}[0pt][0pt]%
%  {\parbox{\columnwidth}{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}%
%  \global\everypar=\everypar}}%
%  \vspace{-1\baselineskip}\vspace{-\parskip}\par
%\else
%  \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}\par
%\fi
%
% Admittedly, this is a hack and may well be fragile, but seems to do the
% trick for me. Note the need to keep any \label that may be used right
% after \section in the above as the hack puts \section within a raised box.



% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he}   main purpose of graphics is to summarize data and present them in a way that readers are able to extract the main message(s) quickly and with a minimum of distortion (cleveland, tufte - lie-factor). 

As designers of charts we have to be aware of the innate or culturally imposed perceptual limitations of our audience.

%% from http://what-when-how.com/sociology/statistical-graphics/
%The effectiveness of statistical graphs is rooted in the remarkable ability of people to apprehend, process, and remember pictorial information. The human visual system, however, is subject to distortion and illusion, processes that can affect the perception of graphs. Good graphical design can minimize and counteract the limitations of human vision. In Figure 9, for example, it appears that the difference between the hypothetical import and export series is changing when this difference actually is constant (cf., Playfair’s time series graph in Figure 2 a). 

The top chart in Figure \ref{playfair} shows Playfair's  visualization of the balance of trade between England and the East Indies as published in his Commercial and Political Atlas, 1786 \cite{playfair, playfair2}. The chart at the bottom of  figure \ref{playfair}, where a line is sketched for the difference between imports and exports. The steep rise in the difference between the lines starting just before 1760 is missed by many onlookers, exhibiting a particularly strong line width illusion. This phenomenon  is known and widely discussed in statistical graphics literature \citep{cleveland:1984, wainer:2000, robbins:2005}. 
The line width illusion is due to our  tendency to assess distance between curves as the minimal (orthogonal) distance rather than the  vertical distance -- see sketch \ref{fig:linewidth} for a more detailed discussion and some results from a user study.

We will next give an overview of  charts commonly used for displaying associations between categorical variables within the framework of parallel coordinate plots, and discuss their performance with respect to the line width illusion.

XXX Why don't we mention mosaics? - I don't want to, but we need a better reason

\subsection{Parallel Coordinate Plots for Categorical Data}


Parallel Sets have been introduced by R Kosara \citep{kosara:2006} as a way to visualize categorical data within the framework of parallel coordinate plots \citep{pcp:1885, inselberg:1985, wegman:1990} and have by now spread into main media, see e.g. the article on decision making in the BBC \citep{bbc:2009}. 

XXX Description of parallel sets - and example

However, the parallel sets plot suffer from a line width illusion, that can -- as we demonstrate in this paper -- be so severe as to lead the user to wrong conclusions about the displayed data. 
Hammock plots \citep{schonlau:2003} provide an alternative to parallel sets that does not suffer from the illusion. 
XXX Description of hammock plots and example

Hammock plots need control over the plotting device - such as a fixed aspect ratio, which is sometimes problematic. 
In this paper, we propose a new approach to visualizing categorical variables in a parallel coordinate plot setting, called the {\it common angle} display.

\label{tab:results}
\end{center}
\end{table}



Table \ref{tab:results} shows an overview of the results from the survey: 7 out of 12 participants evaluating the barcharts identify the correct order, whereas none of the 13 participants evaluating the parallel sets plot do (XXXX significance?). This is due to a strong preference of evaluating the width of lines orthogonal to their slopes as opposed to horizontally (see sketch \ref{fig:linewidth}), as would be needed for a correct assessment of the parallel sets plot.
Orthogonal $w_o$ and horizontal $w_h$ linewidths are related -- the orthogonal linewidth depends on the angle (or slope) of the line:
\[
w_o = w_h \text{cos } \theta,
\]
where $\theta$ is the angle of the line with respect to the horizontal line.
While the intuitive assessment of line widths by their width orthogonal to slope is well known (XXX point towards Playfair's import export chart/  need literature reference here), it is surprising to see its strength: in this particular setting, it is strong enough to `shrink' the horizontally widest line by more than 16\%, from 212 to below 178.

\caption{\label{fig:aspect}Parallel sets plots of survival on the Titanic by class. Different aspect ratios  seemingly change the (orthogonal) line width, compare e.g. number of survivors in 3rd class and in the crew. }
\end{figure*}

The slope very much depends on the aspect ratio of a plot - changing the aspect ratio will change the assessment of the order. Figure \ref{fig:aspect} shows the same parallel sets plot of survival on the Titanic by class: in the left plot the number of surviving 3rd class passengers seems to be about twice as big as the number of survivors among crew members, whereas on the right the lines have about equal (orthogonal) width.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.

% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
