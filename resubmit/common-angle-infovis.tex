%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is

%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier. Further, ``electronic'' includes
%% hyperreferences for more convenient online viewing.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Please note that the use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page
%% of the journal version.  Figures should begin on the second page and be
%% in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour shifting may occur

%% first page will be refused.

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
Visualizations are great tools of communications - they summarize findings and quickly convey main messages to our audience. As designers of charts we have to make sure that information is shown with a minimum of distortion. We have to also consider illusions and other perceptual  limitations of our audience. In this paper we discuss  the effect and strength of the  line width illusion,  a M\"uller-Lyer type illusion, on designs related to displaying associations between categorical variables. Parallel sets and hammock plots are both affected by line width illusions. We  introduce the common-angle plot as an alternative method for displaying categorical data in a manner that minimizes the effect from perceptual illusions.
Finally, we present results from user studies as evidence that common angle charts resolve  problems with the line width illusion.
